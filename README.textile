h1. ZooKeeper Digest

*Author: "Patrick Hunt":http://people.apache.org/~phunt/* (follow me on "twitter":http://twitter.com/phunt)

h2. Summary

*This is a work in progress, use at your own risk*

"This project":http://github.com/phunt/zookeeper-digest was inspired by "Maatkit's":http://www.maatkit.org/ mk-query-digest utility. This is essentially a log analysis tool, currently focused on analyzing real time traffic details as captured by "tcpdump":http://www.tcpdump.org/

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.

h2. Overview

Capture information from a ZooKeeper cluster and this tool will output an analysis of the interactions/operations.

h2. Requirements

* "tcpdump":http://www.tcpdump.org/
* Python 2.6

h2. Usage

<code>
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> port <zk client port> -s 65535  -x -n -q -tttt | ./zookeeper-digest.py
</code>

where <zk client port> is typically 2181 and <interface> typically eth0 or ath0 or wlan0, etc...

h2. Future

Add support for parsing ZooKeeper log files.
